# Sketch to Diagram
Sketch to Diagram was built in a hackathon type event applying modern machine learning methods. SKtD is a proof of concept web app that uses a convolutional neural network based model to identify user drawings which are then converted into rendered objects. The goal of SKtD was to demonstrate how a non-trivial problem such as gesture recognition could be tackled in a flexible manner using modern machine learning in a user application. The application runs completely within the web browser [here](http://sketch-to-diagram.surge.sh) 

SKtD currently supports rendering 6 shapes and works best using a tablet/iPad
  - Squares/Rectangles
  - Circles/Ellipses
  - Triangles
  - Lines
  - Hexagons
  - Stars
